                <p>This very website is a project in itself! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is a proud showcase of my skills, passions, and work, continuously evolving as I learn and improve my web development abilities.</p>

                <h2>Ticket Booking System</h2>
                <p>Developed a ticket booking system for 100 seats using Python, Tkinter and MySQL. The system provides a GUI to select seats according to seat number and disagrammatically presents how far the rows are from the screen. When the user books a ticket, it is updated in the database in real time. The database also refreshes the seats per show as per the date.</p>
